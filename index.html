            <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
            <p>The title names the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord <span>Sauron</span>, who had in an earlier age created the
                One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all
                of Middle-earth.</p>

            <h2>Dune</h2>
            <p>Set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control
                planetary fiefs, Dune tells the story of young <span>Paul Atreides</span>, whose family accepts the stewardship of
                the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is
                the only source of melange, or "the spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities.
                Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and
                foresight that only the drug provides.[6] As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the
                planet is thus a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multi-layered interactions of
                politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each
                other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice</p>

            <h2>Star Wars</h2>
            <p>The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",
                in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots, or <span>'droids'</span>, who may

                technology.</p>
